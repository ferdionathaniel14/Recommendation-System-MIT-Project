With the advent of technology, societies have become more efficient with their lives. But at the same time, individual human lives have become much more fast-paced and distracted, leaving little time to explore artistic pursuits. Also, technology has made significant advancements in the ability to coexist with art and general entertainment. It has made it easier for humans with a shortage of time to find and consume good content. Therefore, one of the key challenges for the companies is to be able to figure out what kind of content their customers are most likely to consume. Almost every internet-based company's revenue relies on the time consumers spend on their platforms. These companies need to be able to figure out what kind of content is needed to increase the time spent by customers on their platform and make their experience better.
Spotify is one such audio content provider that has got a huge market base across the world. It has grown significantly because of its ability to recommend the ‘best’ next song to each and every customer based on the huge preference database they have gathered over time like millions of customers and billions of songs. This is done by using smart recommendation systems that can recommend songs based on the users’ likes/dislikes
